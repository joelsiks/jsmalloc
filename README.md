TLSF: a new dynamic memory allocator for real-time systems

The implementation is written in C++14 for 64-bit machines exclusively and uses some compiler intrinsics (`__builtin_ffsl`, `__builtin_clzl`).

## TODO

Implement free/last bits inside block length.

Implement some helper functions for masking out the F/T bits from the size to get the actual size of blocks.

Check alignment when in allocate()

Implement coalesce_blocks()
